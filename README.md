### Yap session
I often think about how much time has passsed since graduating high school. I graduated in 2020. At the very beginning of the pandemic. I had a lot of setbacks that put me behind where I expected myself to be. Yet, I feel as if having all that time to really reflect on myself has only been helpful. I am finally in a position where I can make up for lost time. Motivated more than ever to find my place and learn as much as I can while I still can. It's been four years. MY plan was to already have a bachelor's and be looking for work now. Things don't always play out as we want. But, if it wasn't for these past few years, I would have missed out on some of my best memories. I wouldn't have met some of the people I now consider my closest friends. For that, I am eternally grateful, and it has made everything worth it. I am hopeful of where I will go next and the things I will achieve.
